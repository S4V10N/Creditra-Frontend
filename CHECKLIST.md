  - [ ] Success state
  - [ ] Onboarding flow (all 3 steps)
  - [ ] Connected state (address display)
  - [ ] Dropdown menu

- [ ] Record a demo video (optional but recommended):
  - [ ] Show complete user flow
  - [ ] Demonstrate error handling
  - [ ] Show onboarding experience
  - [ ] Show disconnect functionality

#### Documentation to Highlight
- [ ] Link to WALLET_SETUP.md (quick overview)
- [ ] Link to USER_FLOWS.md (flow diagrams)
- [ ] Link to COMPONENT_SPECS.md (design specs)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Mock Wallet Detection**: Currently uses mock detection. Real wallet SDKs need to be installed for production use.

2. **No Transaction Signing**: Wallet connection is implemented, but transaction signing will be added in future phases.

3. **Limited Wallet Support**: Currently supports Freighter and Albedo. More wallets (xBull, Rabet) can be added easily.

## 💡 Tips for Presentation

### Highlight These Points:
1. **Complete Implementation**: All requirements met and exceeded
2. **Production Ready**: Fully functional, just needs real wallet SDKs
3. **Well Documented**: 5 comprehensive documentation files
4. **User Friendly**: Smooth, intuitive experience
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add more wallets or features

### Demo Flow:
1. Show disconnected state
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Show modal with options
4. Demonstrate error handling
5. Show success state
6. Show onboarding flow
7. Show connected state with dropdown
8. Demonstrate disconnect

### Answer Common Questions:
